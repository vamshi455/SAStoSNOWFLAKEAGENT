SAStoSNOWFLAKEAGENT
A comprehensive sample project demonstrating a multi-agent system for migrating SAS code to Snowflake. This project includes sample SAS code, AI-driven agents, and a complete migration pipeline to facilitate the conversion of SAS projects to Snowflake solutions.
Overview
The SAStoSNOWFLAKEAGENT project provides a robust framework for automating the migration of SAS programs to Snowflake. It includes a modular architecture with specialized AI agents to handle various aspects of the migration process, from code discovery to schema conversion and testing. The system is extensible, configurable, and designed to handle real-world SAS codebases with proper setup.
Features

Full Working Code: Complete implementation of all AI agents and migration logic.
Configuration Management: Supports multiple environments through YAML configuration files.
Sample SAS Programs: Includes SAS code samples of varying complexity for testing and demonstration.
Comprehensive Schema Definitions: Metadata-driven schema conversion for Snowflake compatibility.
Setup and Execution Scripts: Simplifies deployment and execution of the migration pipeline.
Testing Framework: Validates the correctness of migrated code and schemas.
Detailed Documentation: Guides users in understanding, using, and extending the system.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Snowflake account with appropriate credentials
Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sas_snowflake_migration.git
cd sas_snowflake_migration


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure the system:

Update config/snowflake_connection.yaml with your Snowflake credentials.
Modify config/migration_config.yaml to specify migration parameters (e.g., source SAS files, target Snowflake database).



Usage

Place your SAS programs in the sample_data/ directory or specify a custom directory in migration_config.yaml.
Run the main migration script:python src/main.py


Review the generated reports in the output directory (configured in migration_config.yaml) for migration details and validation results.

Example
To migrate a sample SAS program:

Ensure sample_data/ contains SAS files.
Configure snowflake_connection.yaml with valid credentials.
Run:python src/main.py --config config/migration_config.yaml



The system will:

Discover SAS code and metadata (discovery_agent.py).
Convert schemas to Snowflake DDL (schema_agent.py).
Translate SAS logic to Snowflake SQL (code_conversion_agent.py).
Preserve business logic (business_logic_agent.py).
Validate the migration (testing_agent.py).
Generate a migration report (report_generator.py).

Extending the System

Add New Agents: Create new agent modules in src/agents/ and register them in orchestration_agent.py.
Custom Parsers: Extend sas_parser.py to handle specific SAS constructs.
Snowflake Optimizations: Modify sql_generator.py to include advanced Snowflake features (e.g., query optimization, snowpipes).

Testing
Run the testing framework to validate migrations:
python src/agents/testing_agent.py

The testing agent compares the output of migrated Snowflake queries against original SAS outputs to ensure functional equivalence.
